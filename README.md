This is an historical curiosity that I've uploaded to Github for
archival and amusement value (for me, at any rate). 

## Matrix Orbital LCD Panels

I wrote this code in the late 1990s to interface to one of
[Matrix Orbital](https://www.matrixorbital.com/)'s very first serial
port LCD panels.

At the time, the [BeBox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeBox) was
still the new hotness, and it had two real time CPU bar displas on its
front panel, and everyone with a regular PC wanted something like that
too.

The Matrix Orbital panel connected to a serial port, had 2 lines of
display, and there were a couple of versions that could mount in a
standard PC drive bay.

There's a driver program which builds as a Windows NT service, and it
can load new screens at startup time through a DLL plugin interface.
